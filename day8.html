    <h1>Chapter 1</h1>
    <p>
      Aristotle was born in 384 B.C. in Stagira in northern Greece. Both of his
      parents were members of traditional medical families, and his father,
      Nicomachus, served as court physician to King Amyntus III of Macedonia.
      His parents died while he was young, and he was likely raised at his
      family's home in Stagira. At age 17 he was sent to Athens to enroll in
      Plato's Academy. He spent 20 years as a student and teacher at the school,
      emerging with both a great respect and a good deal of criticism for his
      teacher's theories. Plato's own later writings, in which he softened some
      earlier positions, likely bear the mark of repeated discussions with his
      most gifted student.
    </p>
    <h1 id="C2">Chapter 2</h1>
    <p>
      When Plato died in 347, control of the Academy passed to his nephew
      Speusippus. Aristotle left Athens soon after, though it is not clear
      whether frustrations at the Academy or political difficulties due to his
      family's Macedonian connections hastened his exit. He spent five years on
      the coast of Asia Minor as a guest of former students at Assos and Lesbos.
      It was here that he undertook his pioneering research into marine biology
      and married his wife Pythias, with whom he had his only daughter, also
      named Pythias.
